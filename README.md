# The Food Specification
This repository contains the specification of Food. The specifications are the documents that officially explain the Food language,
and how it should be implemented to be officially compatible.

## Food 1.1 (WIP)
The next evolution of Food. It will not be backwards compatible with Food 1.0 (Food 1.0 lacked many features and details.) It is currently
slowly being designed. It aims to be the first *usable* and concrete version of Food.
 
## [Food 1.0](draft10/README.md)
Food 1.0 is the first version of the Food specification. It lacks a lot of information (it is more or less left to the implementation.)
It is designed for writing basic implementations of Food.

## About Extensions
Extensions can be applied to an implementation to extend Food's features beyond the official specification. For the implementation to remain
officially compliant, they must not prevent the compilation or execution of valid official source code. Moreover, the source code should
output code that works as intended.

## About Downloading
If you wish to download a version of the specification, please download the whole folder, as it is split across multiple files.
Drafts are usually still worked on (except for Food 1.0) and can change at any moment.
